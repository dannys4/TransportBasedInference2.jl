*A framework for Bayesian inference with transport maps*

The objective of this package is to allow for easy and fast resolution of Bayesian inference problems using transport maps. The package provides tools for:
- joint and conditional density estimation from limited samples of the target distribution using the adaptive transport map algorithm developed by Baptista et al. [^1].
- sequential inference for state-space models using one of the following algorithms: the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen [^2]), the ensemble transform Kalman filter (Bishop et al. [^3]) and a nonlinear generalization of the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (Spantini et al. [^4]).

This package has been designed to address the following question:

Given samples $\boldsymbol{x}^i \sim \pi$
For a random variable $\mathsf{X} \sim \pi$ where $\pi$ a complex distribution of interest, can we identify a transformation $\boldsymbol{S}$ such that the target distribution is pushed forward to a reference density $\eta$ (e.g. the standard Gaussian distribution).
